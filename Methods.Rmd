## Data
Climate data is from [gridMET](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html), which reports various climate variables at a 4km x 4km resolution. The ones we used are daily maximum temperature, daily maximum relative humidity, daily minimum relative humidity, and daily mean specific humidity. 

Population data is from the state level [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.html) 1-year data from the US Census Bureau. We used the total population and population under 18 for each year and state.

Influenza like illness (ILI) and percent positive data is from the [CDC](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html).
